                <h2>Fuzz? What does it do?</h2>

                <p>Fuzz randomly generates a background image noise effect on a web page using the canvas element. No need for Photoshop and images (assuming you have a canvas capable browser).</p>

                <p>You can set your background using CSS and apply the noise after. There are a number of options to customise the noise, so you can get some pretty neat and subtle effects. It's also more than capable of making any page look completely disgusting and rubbish. It's a double-edged sword, if I'm honest.</p>

                <p>I don't know whether this is necessarily better or easier than using an image prepared in Photoshop, but I think it's pretty neat that it's possible to generate this in the browser. I suppose you wouldn't necessarily go to the effort of making horrible looking noise with Photoshop, so if disgusting blocks of grey/colour is your thing, this is how to make it happen fast! </p>

                <p>This project is mainly just for fun and learning - I'll occasionally be adding to this if there's a new thing or idea I want to try out.</p>

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Canvas-capable browser (if the noise needs to display)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> JavaScript library included on the page</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can still include the plugin on browsers which cannot use the canvas element, but it won't do anything. I haven't tested with a range of jQuery versions yet. It will definitely be fine with 1.5+ but to be honest, it uses jQuery in such a rudimentary way that earlier versions shouldn't have much of a problem with it.</p>

                <h2>Download</h2>

                <p>Download the zip <a href="files/jquery-fuzz.zip">here</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/chrishksang/Fuzz">github</a>.</p>
                
                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>Add the plugin and jQuery to your HTML file. Use the plugin like so:</p>

                <p class="code">$('body').fuzz();</p>

                <p>There are some parameters you can pass in (see full list below) like so:</p>

                <p class="code">$('body').fuzz({pixel: 4, size: 160, color: true});</p>

                <p>If you have sections of your page with different backgrounds you'll need to put these in your jQuery selector. For example, for this page, the header and footer have a different background colour, so I need to use:</p>

                <p class="code">$('body, header, footer').fuzz();</p>

                <p>Or you can have different settings for different sections. On this page, I have a different noise setting on the header and footer.</p>

                <p class="code">$('#main').fuzz();</p>

                <p class="code">$('header, footer').fuzz({color:true, pixel: 8, opacity: 0.06, size: 200});</p>

                <h3>The options</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>color</b>: true (for colour noise) or false (for greyscale noise). Defaults to false.</li>
                    <li><b>sepia</b>: true or false. Adds a sepia tone to the noise. Defaults to false.</li>
                    <li><b>size</b>: 0 to 500. Refers to the height/width size of the generated image. This defaults to 100, which generates a 100x100 pixel image. This should be large enough to not notice repeats, but small enough that it doesn't take too long to draw. The limit of 500 is fairly arbitrary, when I tested this, it took around 1.2 seconds to run the function with a 500x500 pixel image, which I think is probably actually too long to add to your page load time really. With a 100x100 pixel image, it takes around 50ms to run the function, so should be satisfactorily unnoticeable. </li>
                    <li><b>opacity</b>: 0 to 1. Refers to the opacity of the generated image, or essentially, how much noise you see on the page. This defaults to 0.075, which applies a subtle amount of noise. Values higher than about 0.15 may start pushing the boundaries of taste.</li>
                    <li><b>pixel</b>: 1 to 100. Refers to the pixel size. Defaults to 1px. You can increase this to get a bit of a blocky effect going. I'd recommend making sure that it's a value that the size of your image is divisible by. So if it were the default of 100, then 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25 etc would be good numbers. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Some notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>This should work pretty well in any browser that is capable of using the canvas element. It's worked for me in IE9, Chrome 11, Firefox 4 and Safari 5. </li>
                    <li>In theory, it should be possible to layer the noise on top of an existing background image or gradient with CSS3's multiple backgrounds. The plugin does check for the existence of background-image properties, and if any do exist, adds the noise without overwriting them. The resulting markup looks right but for some reason it doesn't actually work. What happens is that the originally specified background image or gradient is shown, sans noise. So if you want noise over existing background images or gradients, treat it like CSS2 where you have one background per element. Then you can have a background image/gradient on your container element (e.g. a &lt;div id="wrapper"&gt; type element) and the noise applied to the elements inside that.</li>
                    <li>At the moment, the greyscale noise is just grey but I would like to add an option where you can have noise in a particular colour/hue.</li>
                    <li>I tried in vain to use the British spelling for 'colour' in the plugin but unfortunately it just confused me. So it's 'color'.</li>
                    <li>The HTML isn't pretty (if that matters)</li>
                    <li>This is my first jQuery plugin, so there may be a few things that I haven't considered or that could be improved. I'd love to hear them.</li>
                </ul>
