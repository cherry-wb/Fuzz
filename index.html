            <h1>Fuzz</h1>

            <p>jQuery plugin to create background image noise using the canvas element.</p>

            <h2>Fuzz? What does it do?</h2>

            <p>Fuzz randomly generates a background image noise effect on a web page using the canvas element. No need for Photoshop and images (assuming you have a canvas capable browser...!).</p>

            <p>You can set your background using CSS and apply the noise after.</p>

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Canvas-capable browser</li>
                <li>jQuery JavaScript library included on the page</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>Add the plugin and jQuery to your HTML file. Call the plugin like so:</p>

            <p>e.g: $('body').fuzz();</p>

            <p>If you have sections of your page with different backgrounds you'll need to put these in your jQuery selector. For example, for this page, the header and footer have a different background colour, so I need to use:</p>

            <p>$('body, header, footer').fuzz();</p>

            <p></p>

            <h3>The options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>color</b>: true (for colour noise) or false (for greyscale noise)</li>
                <li><b>size</b>: 0 to 500. Refers to the size of the generated image. This defaults to 100, which generates a 100x100 pixel image. This should be large enough to not notice repeats, but small enough that it doesn't take too long to draw. The limit of 500 is fairly arbitrary, when I tested this, it took around 1.2 seconds to run the function with a 500x500 pixel image, which I think is probably actually too long to add to your page load time really. With a 100x100 pixel image, it takes around 50ms to run the function, so should be satisfactorily unnoticeable. </li>
                <li><b>opacity</b>: 0 to 1. Refers to the opacity of the generated image, or essentially, how much noise you see on the page. This defaults to 0.075, which applies a very subtle amount of noise.</li>
                <li>The HTML isn't pretty (if that matters)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notes/future steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In theory, it should be possible to layer the noise on top of an existing background image with CSS3 multiple backgrounds. The plugin does check for the existence of background-image properties, and if any do exist, adds the noise without overwriting them. The resulting markup looks right but for some reason it doesn't actually work. So if you want noise over existing background images, treat it like CSS2 where you have one background per element.</li>
                <li>At the moment, the greyscale noise is just grey but I would like to add an option where you can have noise in a particular colour.</li>
                <li>I tried in vain to use the British spelling for 'colour' in the plugin but unfortunately it just confused me. So it's 'color'.</li>
            </ul>
