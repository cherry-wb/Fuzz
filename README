This is mainly just a fun little plugin I made to learn some JavaScript.

What does it do?
----------------

Fuzz randomly generates a background image noise effect on a web page using the canvas element. It's a small plugin (only 2KB minified) and in most cases runs very quickly.

Fuzz requires jQuery and will only display noise in a canvas capable browser. You can still include it in browsers which can't display canvas, but it won't do anything.

You could use it add subtle noise to classily enhance your page or alternatively pollute it with random blocks!

Usage
-----

Select which elements you want noise on using jQuery. Optionally pass in some parameters. See http://fuzz.chks.me for more details.

$('element').fuzz({options: option});

Notes
-----

It seems you can't combine this with a background image or gradient on the same element, though in theory, with CSS3, you should be able to.
